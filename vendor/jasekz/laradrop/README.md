# Laradrop

[![Software License][ico-license]](LICENSE.md)


This is a file manager using Dropzone.js for Laravel 5.  It provides basic functionality for managing, uploading,
and deleting files.

## Installation

NOTE: If you haven't set up a database yet for your app, please do that first as per Laravel docs -  http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/database.

Via composer
```
composer require jasekz/laradrop
```
```
composer update
```

Then in your `config/app.php` add 
```php
    'Jasekz\Laradrop\LaradropServiceProvider'
```    
in the `providers` array and
```php
    'Laradrop' => 'Jasekz\Laradrop\LaradropFacade'
```
to the `aliases` array.

Finally, run 

    artisan vendor:publish
    
followed by

    artisan migrate

Now in your .env file, define your file upload paths and urls:
```php
LARADROP_STORAGE_ENGINE=local
LARADROP_INITIAL_UPLOADS_DIR=/absolute/path/to/storage
LARADROP_STORAGE_ENGINES.LOCAL.UPLOADS_DIR=/absolute/path/to/public/uploads
LARADROP_STORAGE_ENGINES.LOCAL.PUBLIC_LOCATION=/uploads
```
## Usage
This package requires Dropzone.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, as well as some application level js.  Include these somewhere in your view:
``` php
<link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
<script src="/vendor/jasekz/laradrop/js/enyo.dropzone.js"></script>
<script src="/vendor/jasekz/laradrop/js/laradrop.js"></script>
```

NOTE:  I plan on removing the Bootstrap requirement, however, right now it is needed for the modal dialog and styling.

Add a button where you want to implement the file manager:
``` html
<div class="laradrop"
  laradrop-upload-handler="{{ route('laradrop.store') }}"
  laradrop-file-delete-handler="{{ route('laradrop.destroy') }}" 
  laradrop-file-source="{{ route('laradrop.index') }}"
  laradrop-csrf-token="{{ csrf_token() }}" >
  <button class='btn btn-primary laradrop-select-file' >Add File</button>
</div>
```

Finally, bind the button using jQuery:
```javascript
<script>
jQuery(document).ready(function(){
	jQuery('.laradrop').laradrop({
		onInsertCallback: function (src){
		  // this is called when the 'select' button is clicked on a thumbnail
			alert('File '+src+' selected.  Please implement onInsertCallback().');
		}
	});
});
</script>
```

## Events
Laradrop currently fires two events:

1. **Jasekz\Laradrop\Events\FileWasUploaded** - this is fired as soon as the file is uploaded to the initial uploads directory, as defined by ```LARADROP_INITIAL_UPLOADS_DIR```.  At this point, the file is not yet saved in the database, thumbnails are not created and it is not moved to the final location, as defined by ```LARADROP_STORAGE_ENGINES.LOCAL.UPLOADS_DIR```.
2. **Jasekz\Laradrop\Events\FileWasDeleted** - this is fired as soon as the file is deleted from the database.  At this point, the file and thumbnails still reside in the uploads dir, as defined by ```LARADROP_STORAGE_ENGINES.LOCAL.UPLOADS_DIR```.

## Handlers (upload, delete, list)
If you'd like to implement your own hanldlers (or extend the existing ones with your own controllers), you can do so.  All you need to do, is to defined the routes to the appropriate handlers in the button attributes.  This also allows you to easily have multiple handlers for different use cases, if so desired.
``` html
<div class="laradrop"
  laradrop-upload-handler="{{ route('laradrop.store') }}"  <!-- Redefine to point to your file storage function -->
  
  laradrop-file-delete-handler="{{ route('laradrop.destroy') }}" <!-- Redefine to point to your file deletion function -->
  
  laradrop-file-source="{{ route('laradrop.index') }}" <!-- Redefine to point to your file list function -->
  
  laradrop-csrf-token="{{ csrf_token() }}" >
  
  <button class='btn btn-primary laradrop-select-file' >My Custom Button</button>
</div>
```
